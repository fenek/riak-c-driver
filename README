--- 1. Overview ---
Riak[1] is a No-SQL database, which emphasizes on replication and data distribution. This driver/library provides means to communicate with Riak instances using cURL[2] and Protocol Buffers[3][4]. In fisrt case, it works as cURL wrapper and HTTP response parser. In second case, it communicates via TCP socket. Originally this library was created during attempts of benchmarking Riak in comaprison to MongoDB[5] and MySQL[6] and it was decided that it deserves being a separate project. ;)
Right now this driver provides very limited functionality, but it's definitely something to start with.

--- 2. Requirements ---
Dependencies for this project: (header files required for compilation)
- cURL
- Protocol Buffers
- Protocol Buffers for C
- json-c[7]

C standard library is also required. Library was tested with gcc but it should work fine with other C compilers.

--- 3. Installation ---

First make sure you have installed all dependencies.

Then just type
$ make
and then (as superuser)
# make install

This will create dynamic-linked library libriakdrv.so and copy it to PREFIX/lib (default PREFIX: /usr/local). Additionaly riakdrv.h header file will be copied to PREFIX/include.

If you want to uninstall the library, use
# make uninstall
This will erase both .so and .h file.

If you want to compile test application (which can also suit as an example how to use the driver), type
$ make test

--- 4. Usage ---

To use the library, just include riakdrv.h header file and add -lriakdrv to your linker parameters.

For detailed documentation check doc/ directory.

--- 5. TODO list ---
- rewrite remaining possible functions from cURL to Protocol Buffers 
- getting JSON from DB by key
- logging
- tests

- aided MapReduce statement creation?

--- 6. Buglist ---
Probably too many to list. :) It's very alpha version though...
